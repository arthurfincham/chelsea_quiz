<h3>Description</h3>

In making this quiz I tried to use different ways of answering the questions to practice getting their value in the Javascript file.

For example...
<ul>
  <li>Range slider</li>
  <li>Radio buttons wrapped in images</li>
  <li>Customised Text Input</li>
  <li>Radio buttons wrapped in text</li>
</ul>

Doing so meant I had to learn the difference between...
```
document.getElementById().innerHTML
```
```
document.querySelector().value
```
```
document.querySelectorAll()
```
...so that I could get the logic working!


Also used a sticky scrolling effect in CSS.
