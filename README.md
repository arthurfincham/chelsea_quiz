<h2>:wrench: Mechanics</h2>

In making this quiz I tried to use **different ways of answering** the questions to practice getting their value in the **JS** file.

For example...
<ul>
  <li>Range sliders</li>
  <li>Radio buttons wrapped in images</li>
  <li>Customised text input</li>
  <li>Radio buttons wrapped in text</li>
</ul>

Doing so meant I had to learn the difference between...
```
document.getElementById().innerHTML
```
```
document.querySelector().value
```
```
document.querySelectorAll()
```
...so that I could get the **user input** into the **JS** and check the answers.

<h2>:art: Design (CSS)</h2>

When researching how to make a simple quiz, I found lots of good examples but few were visually appealing. This meant I had to dive into the **CSS**, which took up more time than any other part of the project.

I'm fairly pleased with the results, although my code is quite clunky and longer than it needs to be.

This [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) showed me how to include and style the range slider.

This [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17541614/use-images-instead-of-radio-buttons) on *stackoverflow* taught me how to wrap radio buttons.

Another [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717527/smooth-scrolling-when-clicking-an-anchor-link) on *stackoverflow* gave me smooth scrolling when using my anchor link buttons.

<h3>:iphone: Mobile</h3>
*Update 29th June.*

The app now *works* on mobile, but the images are not well aligned.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Refactor the <strong>CSS</strong> and remove unnecessary code.</li>
  <li>Refactor the <strong>HTML</strong> and get rid of unused <i>divs</i>.</li>
  <li>Make the app more responsive on mobile.</li>
</ul>
